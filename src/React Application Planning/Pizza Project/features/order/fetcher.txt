useFetcher is a React Router hook used to call loaders or actions without changing the URL or navigating to another route.


A loader is a function used to FETCH data for a route. (get data before or rendering a page )\
a action is a function used to send or mutate data.

| Feature | Purpose          | Type of Data |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| Loader  | Fetch data       | Read (GET)   |
| Action  | Send/change data | Write (POST) |


const fetcher = useFetcher();

useEffect(() => {
  if (!fetcher.data && fetcher.state === "idle") {
    fetcher.load("/menu");
  }
}, []);
/menu has a loader
fetcher.load() → calls that loader
Data comes into fetcher.data
Page does not navigate to /menu


“useFetcher lets me fetch data without triggering route navigation”
“It’s useful for background data like ingredients, autocomplete, or side data”
“It follows the same loader system as React Router routes”
“State management is built-in using fetcher.state”
