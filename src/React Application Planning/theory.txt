How to plan and build a react application

from the earlier "thinking in react" lec:-
but this works for small apps with one page and few features 
in real-world apps, we need to abapt this process 
1)breaking the desired UI into components 
2)build a static version (no state yet)
3)think about state management + data flow 

important :-
when we build a larger and more real world application we need to start by gathering the application requirments and features

based on that we can divide that application into pages 
!)think about the overall and page-level ui.
!)break desired ui into componenets.
!)design and build a static version. (no state yet )

then we need to divide the application and application features into multiple features categories so basically we need to place all the features into a few categories so that we can then build the application around those and so that we can oraganize the code into a logically way 
!)think about state management + data flow 

finaly we also need to decide on what lib to use (technology decisions)



project requirments from the business 
1)very simple application, where users can order one or more pizza from a menu 
2)require no user accounts and no login (auth): users just input their name before using the app
3)the pizza menu can change, so it should be loaded from an api 
4)users can add multiple pizzas to a cart before ordering 
5)Ordering requires just the user's name , phone no , address 
6)if possible, GPS location shoudl also be provided , to make delivery easier 
7)users can mark their order as priority for an additional 20% of the card price 
8)orders are made by sending a post request with the order data (user data + selected pizzas) to the api 
9)payments are made on delivery, so no payment processiong is necessary in app 
10)each order will get a unique id that should be displayed, so the user can later look up their order based on the ID  
11)users should be able to mark their order as proirity order even after it has been placed 


FEATURES + PAGES:-
USER category 
MENU category
CART category 
ORDER category

pages :-
HomePage :- /
Pizza menu :- /menu
Cart :- /cart
placing a new order :- /order/new 
Looking up an order :- /order/:orderId


State management amd technology decisions :-
user :- global UI state (no accounts , so stays in app)
menu :- global remote state (menu is fetched fro api )
Cart : - global ui state (no need for api , just stored in app)
order :- global remote state (fetched and submitted to api )
