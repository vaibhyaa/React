whenever some use navigate to application they are basically visiting websites that is hoisted on server 
thats of website and webapps work 
now the user nanvigate to the apps server will send back huge javascript files to teh cliet i.e broswers  that is requesting it and this file is bundle 


this is produced by tool like webpack (inside create-react-app)or vite 
bundle :-
javascript file containing the entire application code.
downloading the bundle will load the entire app at once, turning it into a spa (single page application)

bundle size :- 
amount of javascript users have to download to start using the app. One of the most imp things to be optimized, so that bundle takes less time to download 


code splitting:- it is a technique
splitting bundle into multiple parts that can be downloaded over time ("lazy loading ")
