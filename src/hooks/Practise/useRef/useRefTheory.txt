most easy hook in react to learn 
we use useRef hook to create something called a Ref,

what is ref,?
ref stands for reference 
like a box into ehich we can put any data that we wanted to preserve between renders 
its like a box (object) with mutable .current property that is persisted across the renders 
(normal variables are reser)
Two big usecases for refs :- 
-->create variables that stays the same between renders 
(e.g previous state , setTimeout id . etc )
-->selecting and stored DOM elements

refs are for data that is not rendered . usually only appear in event handlers or effects , not in jsx (otherwise use useState
do not read write or read .current in render logic(like state )
instaed usually perform these mutations inside useEffect hook


state vs refs 
-->both persisted across renders (component rememebers this values even after re-rendering)
--> updating state causes component to renders while updating refs does not 
we use state when we want to store data that shoudl re-render the component and refs for data that should onl be remembered by the component over time, but never re-render it 
-->state is mutable refs are not
-->state updates happen in asynchronous with refs updates are not asynchronous
thats why we can read new property immediately after updating it
