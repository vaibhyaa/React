decalarative syntax to describe what components look like and how they work based on their data and logic
components must return a block of jsx 
extension of javascript that allows us to embed javascript css and react components into ->html  
each jsx element is converted to a React.createElement function call

jsx in declarative (what we want )
declarative=describe what ui looks like using jsx based on current data 
this data is props and state 
abstraction away from dom we never touch the dom directly 
instead , we think of the ui as a reference of current data 

imperative (how to do things)= manual dom element selections and dom traversing
step-by-step DOM mutations until we reach the desired UI
In imperative we tell the browser exactly how to do the things
