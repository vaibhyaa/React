What are Keys?
A key is a special prop you pass to React elements when you create them in a list:
{items.map(item => (
  <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
))}
The key helps React identify which elements have changed, been added, or removed.
Think of it as a unique ID for each rendered element.

Why are Keys Needed?
React uses a process called reconciliation (diffing the virtual DOM with the real DOM).
If React sees that an element’s key hasn’t changed, it will reuse the existing DOM node.
If the key changes, React will destroy the old node and create a new one.
This makes React fast 🚀, but it only works correctly if you provide stable, unique keys.


When Keys Are Important
Keys are critical whenever you:
Map over an array to render a list of components/elements
users.map(user => <UserCard key={user.id} {...user} />)


Update a list (add, remove, reorder items)
Without stable keys, React may shuffle the wrong DOM nodes, leading to bugs.
Example: deleting one item and React “moving” the wrong row’s content.
Conditional rendering inside a list
React might reuse a component unexpectedly if the key doesn’t change.
Animations or transitions
Keys tell React whether something is a new element (animate in) or an existing one (animate update).



Special Case: Forcing Re-mount
Sometimes you want React to treat something as new (like in your quiz app).
Then you can use key on a single component (not in a loop):
<Question key={questionIndex} ... />
This forces React to unmount the old <Question /> and mount a fresh one, resetting its state
