what is redux ?
it is a 3rd-party library to manage global state in web application 
it is standalone library, but easy to intergate with React apps using react-redux library 
all the global state is stored in one globally accessible store. what is easy to update using "actions" (like useReducer)
you need to have a really good understanding of useReducer hook in order to understand redux
Global store is updated --> all consuming components re-render
it conceptually similar to using the context api + useReducer 
two versions of redux 1) classic redux, 2)Modern Redux Toolkit


When do you need to learn redux ?
Redux was used in most react apps for all global state. Today, that has changed, because there are many alternative. Many apps dont need redux anymore, unless they nedd a lot of blobal UI state 

Local state :-
UI state:-
useState
useReducer
useRef
Remote State:- 
fetch+useEffect+ useState/useReducer

Global state:-
UI state:-
context api + useState/useReducer
Redux ,Zustand,Recoil , etc 
React Router
Remote State:- 
context api + useState/useReducer
Redux ,Zustand,Recoil , etc 
React Query
SWR
RTX Query
Ideal use case for Redux, when there is lots of state that updates frequently 
UI State means not fetched from server that would be remote state 
so ui state means simply data about the UI itself or data that doent need to be communicated to a api or so 
For remote global state , we have better , more specialized tools 
the reason why many apps dont use redux 


the mechanism of the useReducer HOOK ?







WHAT IS REDUX MIDDLEWARE?
WHERE TO MAKE AN ASYCH API CALL (or any other async operation) in redux ?
we cannnot make api calls in reducer bez reducer need to be pure fucntion with no side effect so by itself redux store dont know anything about async logic like 
it only knows how to synchronously dispatch action and update the state therefore any asynch operations like api calls need to happen outside reducer 
so instead should may be fetch the data inside the component and then dispatch a action to store with that received data 
usually we want to kepp our component clean and free of data fetching 
and imp data fetching logic capsulated elsewhere all in one place 
fatching data in component is not ideal 
thats where middleware comes into play 
in redux middleware in funciton that sits between the dispatching and the store that means middleware allows devs to run some code after dispatching a action but before that action reaches the reducer in the store 
usually after dispatch the action immediately reaches to reducer funciton and the state is updated 
but with the help of MIDDLEWARE we can do something with the action before that action actually get in reducer funciton 

perfect for asych code , api calls , timers , logging , etc 
the place for side effects 

the most popular middleware in redux calls redux-thunk
 





what is redux Toolkit ?
The modern and preferred way of writing redux code.
An opinionated approach, forcing us to use Redux best practices.
100% compatible with classic redux, allowing us to use them together.
allows us to write a lot less code to achieve the same result 

The highlights are:-
we can write code that "mutates" state inside reducers (will be converted to immutable logic behind the scenes by "Immer" library)
action creators are automatically created.
automatic setup of thunk middleware and devtools 





context API VS REDUX 
CONTEXT API :-
use the context api for global state management in small apps
Build in react 
easy to setup a single context 
additionl state "slides" require new context setup from scratch ("provider hell" in app.js)
no mechanism for async operation  (not use these solutions for remote state )
performance optimization is a pain 
only react devtools 
when you just need to share a value that doesnt change often (color theme , preferred lag , authenticated user ,....)use context api for those 
when you need to solve simple prop drilling problem 
when you need to manage state in local sub-tree of the app 

REDUX:-
use redux for global state management in large apps 
requires additional package (larger bundle size)
more work to set up initially 
once set up , it is easy to create additional state "slices"
supports middleware for async operations (not use these solutions for remote state )
performance is optimized out of the box 
excellent devtools
when you have lots of global ui state that needs to be updated frequently (because Redux is optimized for this )[shopping card, current tabs , complex filters or search ,...
when you have complex state with nested objects and array (because you can mutate state with redux toolkit )
