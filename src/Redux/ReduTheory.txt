what is redux ?
it is a 3rd-party library to manage global state in web application 
it is standalone library, but easy to intergate with React apps using react-redux library 
all the global state is stored in one globally accessible store. what is easy to update using "actions" (like useReducer)
you need to have a really good understanding of useReducer hook in order to understand redux
Global store is updated --> all consuming components re-render
it conceptually similar to using the context api + useReducer 
two versions of redux 1) classic redux, 2)Modern Redux Toolkit


When do you need to learn redux ?
Redux was used in most react apps for all global state. Today, that has changed, because there are many alternative. Many apps dont need redux anymore, unless they nedd a lot of blobal UI state 

Local state :-
UI state:-
useState
useReducer
useRef
Remote State:- 
fetch+useEffect+ useState/useReducer

Global state:-
UI state:-
context api + useState/useReducer
Redux ,Zustand,Recoil , etc 
React Router
Remote State:- 
context api + useState/useReducer
Redux ,Zustand,Recoil , etc 
React Query
SWR
RTX Query
Ideal use case for Redux, when there is lots of state that updates frequently 
UI State means not fetched from server that would be remote state 
so ui state means simply data about the UI itself or data that doent need to be communicated to a api or so 
For remote global state , we have better , more specialized tools 
the reason why many apps dont use redux 


the mechanism of the useReducer HOOK ?
