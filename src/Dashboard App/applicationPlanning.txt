the project :- THE WILD OASIS
thie wild oasis is a small boutique hotel with 8 loxurious wooden cabins
they need a custom-built application to manage everything about the hotel : bookings , cabins , and guests 
this is the internal application used inside the hotel to check in guests as they arrive.
they have nothing right now ,so they also need the api.
later they will probably want a customer-facing website as well , where customers will be able to book stays , using the same api 


HOW TO PLAN A REACT APPLICATION :-
gather business requirements and features 
divide the application into pages 
divide the application into feature categories 
decide on what libraries to use (technology decisions)

Project requirments :-
authentication ,cabins , bookings , check in / out , guests , dashboard settings , 

feature + pages :-
feature categories :- 
bookings 
cabins 
guests  (no page)
dashboard 
check in and out 
app settings authentication  

necessary pages :- 
DASHBOARD :- /dashboard 
BOOKINGS :- /bookings 
CABINS : - /CABINS 
BOOKING CHECK IN :- /checkin/:bookingID
APP SETTINGS :- /settings
USER SIGN UP :- /users
LOGIN :- login 
ACCOUNT SETTINGS :- /account 

STATE: -
MOST OF IT WILL BE GLOBAL REMOTE STATE 


TECHNOLOGY :- 
CLIENT-SIDE RENDERING :- REACT 
used to build single-page application 
ALL html is rendered on the client 
all javascript needs to be doenloaded before apps starting running : bad for performance 
SLIENT-SIDE RENDERING :- NEXT.JS , REMIX 
one perfect use case : apps that are used 'internally'as tools inside companies , that are entirely hidden behind a login 
(this is exactly what we want to build in this project )
used to build multi-page application (MPs)
more performant , as less javascript needs to be downloaded 
the react team is moving more and more in this direction 


TECH STACK :- 
ROUTING :(react router)
the standard for react SPAs
STYLING :- styled component 
very popular way of writing component-scoped CSS , right inside javascript 
REMOTE STATE MANAGEMENT:- react query 
the best way of managing remote state , with features like catching , automatic re-fetching , pre-fetching , offline support , etc Alternatives are SWR and RTK Query   , but this is most popular 
UI STATE MANAGEMENT:- context api 
there is almost no UI state needed in this app , so one simple context with usestate will be enough . no need for redux 
FORM MANAGEMENT:- react hook form 
handling bigger forms can be a lot of work m such as manual state creation , and error handling . a lib can simplify all this 
other tools:- react icons / react hot toast , recharts , date-fns . supabase  




styled components:- 
essentially allow us to write css right inside our javascript component files 
and the way it works is that we take a resular html element and then use that styled function we create a brand new react component with some css style applied to it and then we can use reuse that new component instead of using the regular html ele.
the styled component lib actually gives use its own eay of providing variables like these to our entire application by using a mechanism called themes
supabase used a postgres DB , which is SQL (relations DB)



modeling state :- (for database)
feature categories :-
1)bookings :- 
(booking state powers bookings , dashboard , checkin and checkout )
2)settings:- (settings state )
3)users:- (authentication state)
4)guests:- (guests state )
5)cabins :-(cabins state)
all this state will be global remote state , stored within supabase and managed on frontend using react query
there will be one table for each state (slice) in the database


The booking table :- 
booking are about a guests renting a cabin 
so a booking needs information about what guests is booking which cabin : we need to connect all this 
booking (id)-->guests (id , emil , ...)---->cabin (id , name ...)
supabase used a postgres DB , which is SQL (relations DB) so we need join tables with FOREIGN KEY 
so we take the guest id and store that inside a new field in bookings called GuestID
and same for cabin the booking need to know which cabin was actually booked so we store cabins id in bookings table with name cabinId in booking table 
so both GUESTID and CABINID are FOREIGN KEY stored inside booking table 
we connect a booking with a cabin by storing the cabins id (primary key ) inside the booking cabinId(foregin key) and same for guest
