react query :- 
we will essentially allow react query to take over all fetching and storing of remote data .
remote state management 
react query will take over data fetching and storing 

react query is a powerful lib for managing remote (server) state (state that is stored on server and we need to load into our application )
many features that allow us to write a lot less code, while also making the UX a lot better.


How it works :-
All remote state i.e data is stored in a cache (which means that the fetched data will be stored in order to be reused in different points of the application)
two advantages :- 
it wastes a bit less data to be downloaded
once data is in cache all other component_B here can receive it instantly
react query also automatically gives us all loading and error states 
it also automatically re-fresh the data in certain situations (remote state always stays sync with application)
pre-fetch data means to fetch data that we know will become nesessary later 
easy to mutate :- update remote state using the many tools that are built into react query 
support when user becomes offline (since data is already cached as the user moves around in the app while being offline )

remote state is fundamentally different from UI state (thats why we need lib like this it is asynch )
