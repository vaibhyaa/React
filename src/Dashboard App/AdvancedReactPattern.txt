HOW TO REUSE CODE IN REACT ?
We might want to reuse two big type of code : pieces of UI , statefull logic 
UI :-
for ui reuse we use component and props 
use props as a component API , to enable custom behavior ,Can be stateless , statefull or structural components
children prop (to customize the component content)


STATEFUL LOGIC:- 
custom hooks (custom hooks allows us to write our own react hooks which are composed of any number of any other hooks )


what about visuals , statefull logic at a same time in some more advanced ways :-
render props pattern : for complete control over what the component renders, by passing in funciton that teels the component what to render . was more common before hooks but still useful 
compound component patter:- compound means in this context that we will have muiltiple components that play together on order to create one big super component which is compound component



Higher Order component:-
simply a component that takes an another component and then returns a new component that is better i.e and enhanced version of the initial component
