performance and optimization tools 
1) prevent wasted renders
-->memo and useMemo and useCallback , passing elements as children or regular prop 
2)improve app speed / responsiveness
--> useMemo and useCallback and useTransition hooks 
3)reduce bundle size 
--> using fewer 3rd-party packages and also implement code splitting and lazy loading




when does the component instance re-render ?
a component instance only gets re-renders in 3 different situations:-
1)component state changes 
2)context changes 
3)parent component re-rendering 

technically prop changes does nt re-render the component (common missconception is that when prop changes component re-renders)
what actually happens is that prop only change when parent re-render
but when parent re-render the children receives the prop will re-render anywhay

a render does not mean that the dom actually gets updated , it just menas that component function gets called , but this can be an expensive operation 

wasted render:- a render that didnt produce any change in the dom 
only a problem when they happen too frequently or when the component is very slow 






DON'T OPTIMIZE PREMATURELY
DON'T:-
don't optimize prematurely 
don't optimize anything if there is nothing to optimize
don't wrap all components in memo()
don't wrap all values in useMemo()
don't wrap all funcitons in useCallback()
don't optimize context it its not slow and doen't have many consumers 

DO:- 
fin performance bottlenecks using thr Profiler and visual inspection (laggy ui)
fix those real performance issues 
memoize expensive re-RENDERS
memoize expensive calculations
optimize context if it has many consumers and changes often 
memoize context value + child components
